# DabbleChat
An anonymous live chat system developed in JavaScript, PHP, MySql and a tiny bit of Ajax. Though it was intended as a fun project, this simple-looking chat app went viral on my College Network (it only enjoyed the fame for 3 days
though).

**Dabble.html** : Main Page

**delchat.php** : Use it if you wish to remove all chat messages. Password is: 1xusng23@
Alternatively, you could manually remove all the content with the MySql Command: **delete from messages;**

**chat_handler.php** Edit the data in this file (ip, user, password, database name) so the php script can connect to the database properly.

**Create_db.sql** Run this script to create your Database
